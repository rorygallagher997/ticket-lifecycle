<p>
Login as an agent, we'll use the jane.doe agent account we created in the last lab. Notice how none of the tickets created are available for Jane to solve. We have to give Jane permissions, so log out and sign back in as an admin.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
After signing back in as admin, go to the Agents tab. Select Jane Doe and go to her Access tab. Under extended access, add her to the Support department as well so she can see the tickets.
</p>
<br />
